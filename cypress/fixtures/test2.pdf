Hey! Great article. Btw, don't you think of writing about popular QR scanners next time? I would really like to see that list.

Mobirise Team
Thank you for the idea!

Annabelle Morton
I have a QR code that links to my website. However I would like it to work the following way: if the user is from, say, Germany, I need the QR to open the German version of my website. Could you please suggest how to do this?

Mobirise Team
Hey! You definitely need a dynamic QR code generator. Otherwise I suggest you create a website that dynamically enable the language version of your website depending on some location/IP data of your user.

Deacon Rodriguez
Thanks for the article. I don't really understand what static and dynamic PDF QR codes are. Would you please elaborate?

Mobirise Team
Static QR codes are those that cannot be changed after they are generated, while dynamic QR codes can be edited and customized even after they've been created. The main difference between the two is that static QR codes point to a specific URL or web page, while dynamic QR code contains data that can be updated without having to generate a new code. This means that if you have a static QR code on your website pointing to your landing page, and you want to change where it directs users (say, because you're releasing a new product), then you'll need to create an entirely new code and update all of your materials accordingly. On the other hand, if you have a dynamic QR code with embedded information such as contact details or links to products or services, then you can simply edit the contents of the code without having to create a brand-new one every time something changes. PDF QR codes are a type of barcode that can be read by smartphones and other devices with a camera. When scanned, the device will open up a PDF file that contains additional information about the product or service. This is an convenient way to share digital content without having to physically print it out. A PDF QR code is a type of two-dimensional barcode that can be read by an optical scanner, typically a smartphone camera. The code consists of black and white squares arranged in a square grid on a white background. Each square can be either empty or filled with one of four patterns: dot, solid line segment, forward slash (slash from upper left to lower right), or back slash (from lower left to upper right). These codes are used to store information such as URLs or contact information. When scanned, the phone will display the stored information on its screen.
