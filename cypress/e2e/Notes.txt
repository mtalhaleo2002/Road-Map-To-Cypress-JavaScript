Writing & Executing Tests
-------------------------

Q: How to Write the syntax of Cypress?
--------------------------------------

A: So by default Cypress will follow mocha tests,by using mocha how we can write our tests, first we need to follow syntax so If I just go to their official website , and they have clearly given the syntax .In docs , end-to-end testing para given the syntax

So here it is :

       describe('My First Test', () => {
        it('Does not do much!', () => {
           expect(true).to.equal(true)
         })
       })


So This is basically called a arrow function in JavaScript and without Arrow function also we can write by using function keyword ,so this is 'describe' block and which contains a 'it' block .

So 'describe' is a keyword where you can specify the suite name, and brackets here () => represents the function "Arrow Function" and this function we need to implement inside this 

       describe('Suite Name', () => 
       {



        it('Does not do much!', () => {     
           expect(true).to.equal(true)
         })


       })



So in the 'describe' we can have multiple 'it' blocks this is one block actually so this is a suite name in which it  has 'it' block.It is for writing test like test1, test2 and so on.So you can include any number of tests inside a 'describe' block  


So this is the first parameter for 'describe' which says unit name normally and comma( , ) and this is a bracket and arrow.Arrow is symbol of "Arrow Function" in JavaScript

Same syntax instead of "Arrow Function" , we can used "function()" to create are as follows: 


       describe('Suite Name', function() 
       {



        it('Does not do much!', () => {     
           expect(true).to.equal(true)
         })


       })


And in 'it' block :


        it('Does not do much!', function() 
        {     
           expect(true).to.equal(true)
         }
         
         )

where {} braces start and end, this is actual implementation of 'it' block .And here also use "function()" instead of "Arrow Function".

And you knnow JavaScript can create functions in two different ways 
1: () =>    "Arrow Function"
2: function()  "Function Keyord use"





Q: How we can execute this without using Cypress application?
-------------------------------------------------------------

A: So by using command prompt / terminal , we can still execute the test ,we have to execute this command :

npx cypress run 

( npx cypress open ) command will open the cypress window.
But this 'run' command when runs , it does'nt open any Cypress application , it runs in command prompt / terminal and by default it will follow headless mode because we can't see any UI at the backend.


We can execute the same command just by adding one more option called : 
        npx cypress run --headed 

And this command will execute your test on the headed model ,so when execute this now again runs in cmd prompt/ terminal with Cypress Appllication UI which is launched in browser.
And this is headed Model 

We can execute your spec file by relative path :
        npx cypress run --spec cypress\e2e\mytest.cy.js

And this command will execute your test on headless mode.

And by default browser of Cypress is Electron, but I want to test on some other browsers , so for that :

        npx cypress run --browser chrome

And it runs in headless mode , and if you want to see the UI add --headed in that command and it runs your Cypress application on your browser


Note: 
TestSuite--->TestCase--->Test steps

Spec File(cy.js)----> describe blocks(test suites)----> it blocks ( test )

So this is hierarchy we follow in Cypress terminology
